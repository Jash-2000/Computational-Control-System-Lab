An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot
point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended
stably in this inverted position by using a control system to monitor the angle of the
pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it
starts to fall over, keeping it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem
in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control
strategies.
