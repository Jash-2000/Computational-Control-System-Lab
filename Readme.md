# Computational Control System Lab

The repository contains my __assignment solutions__ and __term project__ of the Control Systems course and Computational Control System Lab course and BITS Pilani. The projects are briefed below. 


  1. **Nyquist Plot Development and Stability analysis** - This assignment involved choosing of appropriate Nyquist contour for an open loop system and determine the values of static gain for which the system's closed loop reains stable. The hand written solution for the same is available [here](https://github.com/Jash-2000/Computational-Control-System-Lab/blob/master/2018A8PS0507P.pdf).
